                INTEC is a student activity center which contains 5 clubs, The
                club is run by students in supervision of faculty members. The
                club aims to uncover those key topics that are not part of the
                curriculum or just grazed upon by the syllabus. Each club deals
                with different technologies, The following are the different
                technologies which are taught by different clubs.

                Web development refers to the building, creating, and
                maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design,
                web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is
                the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e.
                websites.Web Development can be classified into two ways:
                Frontend Development Backend Development. Frontend Development:
                The part of a website that the user interacts directly is termed
                as front end. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the
                application. Backend Development: Backend is the server side of
                a website. It is the part of the website that users cannot see
                and interact. It is the portion of software that does not come
                in direct contact with the users. It is used to store and
                arrange data.

                Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language.It
                runs on billions of devices, including notebook computers,mobile
                devices,gaming etc.And the rules and syntax of Java are based on
                the C and C++ languages.It was created at Sun Microsystems by
                James Gosling in effort to create a new language in consumer
                electronic devices to communicate with each other . The unique
                future of JAVA is it's higher cross-functionality and
                portability.Now,it creates complete applications that can run on
                a single computer or to be distributed cross servers and clients
                in a network.And,it is a server-side language for most back-end
                development projects, including big data and Android
                development.

                VLSI club was introduced with a motive to educate students about
                how the front end and the back end engineers work together to
                design an integrated chip (IC). The club members have gained
                knowledge of digital electronics, Verilog coding, and a detailed
                explanation of how silicon wafers are turned into an IC. The
                future vision of the VLSI club is to work on FPGA boards and
                build a home automation project.

                IOT is basically a network of things capable of communicating
                with other things. Robotics is also about reducing human
                involvement. With robotics, we develop ways to delegate human
                tasks to machines. Robots can assist or even replace humans in
                doing tasks.Robotics and IoT working together are how we can
                actually bring the power of computing into the physical world.

                Avionics, (derived from the expression “aviation electronics”),
                the development and production of electronic instruments for use
                in aviation and astronautics. The term also refers to the
                instruments themselves. Such instruments consist of a wide
                variety of control, performance, communications, and radio
                navigation devices and systems. Control apparatus includes the
                attitude gyro and any number of instruments that indicate power,
                such as the tachometer (in propeller craft), torquemeter (in
                turboprops), and exhaust pressure ratio indicator (in
                turbojets). Performance instruments include the altimeter,
                Machmeter, turn and slip indicator, and varied devices that show
                airspeed, vertical velocity, and angle of attack. Communications
                instruments include two-way radios allowing direct voice
                communication between the aircraft and the ground as well as
                other aircraft; these operate across a wide spectrum, ranging
                from high frequency (HF) through very high frequency (VHF) to
                ultrahigh frequency (UHF). Electronic radio navigation equipment
                ranges from radar to instrument landing systems.
